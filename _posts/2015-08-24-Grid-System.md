<p>As you can see the great system it's a powerful tool from bootstrap it is really important to get to know this because with fees you can modify and adjust every single object on your webpage.</p>

<p>The grid system it's just like a container of content you can show everything you have in your webpage, the grid considers all the screen as a 12 columns units that have the same space. So you can't have all your content well distributed. You need to consider that every time you use this system you will always need to fill the screen you can’t leave just a 6 column alone you need to fill the other half so it won’t mees the other objects.</p>

<p>There are four types of grid in boot strap so you can modify either being on a Computer, on a big screen, or on a cellphone. and the content will adjust to be a better showing product.</p>

<p>Everything is make my classes so the class you will use is almost the same in every case they will just have a little different. the class prefix tells bootstrap which size of the screen the content should appear.</p>

<p>-	The first one is going to be too cellphone screens which is going to be .col-xs-(number) and this one works with screen of 768px and under.</p>

<p>-	The second if for small devices that have equal or more than 768px and you use a .col-sm-(number).</p>

<p>-	Then it came one for medium devices such as a laptop that has equal or more than 990px on their screen and for that one we use .col-md-(number).</p>

<p>-	And last the large screen for those big monitors on the office who have more than 1200px on their screen. we use the .col-lg-(number) class.</p>

<p>As you can see bootstrap has set a class for every occasion. And also remember you can use multiple classes on one item so whatever you want to make something look good on laptop and at the same time on the cellphone, you can put multiple classes together. So you’r not forced to use just one class and just make it look good on one type of device.</p>
