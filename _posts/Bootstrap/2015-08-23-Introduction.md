<p>Hi, today I’m starting to get to know a little more about design on the HTML and CSS world. this time i will learn about Bootstrap one of the most used frameworks more know as tweeter bootstrap because they make it a free source.</p>

<p>Well fist things first let’s start with the introduction as I mention early the bootstrap is a free open source framework that was developed to help the people with the design on their web-pages.</p>

<p>You can visit the official bootstrap web page and there you can find every detail of the framework and how to use it with such a great examples to do it by your self or just start from scratch and get every awesome looking to your web site.</p>

<p>There are now different ways to add the bootstrap library to your HTML doc. One of them and that i usually recommend the most is the one that use the CDN because that is more faster and also it will be always available, and the other ways you can download it and this one also has his own benefits because you may be able to modify the classes that are already predefine and make the web-page look something that you like the most.</p>
